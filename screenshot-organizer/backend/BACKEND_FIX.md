# Backend Fix - Added HTML Serving Routes

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Issue**: WebView showing "Not Found" error

## Problem
The Flask backend had all the API routes but was missing routes to serve the HTML/CSS/JS files needed for the web interface.

## Solution
Added two routes to serve the web app files:

```python
# Serve the main HTML file
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return send_from_directory('..', 'index.html')

# Serve static files (CSS, JS)
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def serve_static(path):
    return send_from_directory('..', path)
```

Also updated Flask configuration:
```python
app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='..', static_url_path='')
```

And added import:
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, send_file, request, send_from_directory
```

## Now Working
- `http://localhost:5001/` → serves `index.html`
- `http://localhost:5001/styles.css` → serves CSS
- `http://localhost:5001/app.js` → serves JavaScript
- `http://localhost:5001/api/*` → API endpoints (unchanged)

## To Apply Fix
1. Backend is already updated
2. Restart the backend: Kill port 5001 and restart
3. Or use the app's "Start Backend" button

The WebView in Sol Unified will now load the full web app! ✅
