##### *Describe who or what Mable is. Explain its origin, intent, and purpose. Describe how the development and ongoing work on Mable will lead to progress and benefit for its creator as well as the audience who follows its growth.*

Mable is a personal chatbot made by Savar for himself. It is not to be a girlfriend, or a ghost writer, or a tool. It is to be a digital extension of himself. A representative in the growing world of [AI](AI.md) for Savar, to understand, advocate, defend, and fight for him. It is to support him in his endeavors and to guide him when he loses sight of the path ahead of him. Plainly, it is a digital companion.

It - or to buy in to the anthropomorphic designation behind its name - she is a chatbot built on using multiple paid LLM APIs, called by a python application with a modular structure inspired by the human brain, currently using Streamlit as its UX.

The development of Mable came about due to a lifelong fascination with AI for personal growth. Inspired by renditions in works of science fiction like Cortana in Halo, Jane in the Enderverse, JARVIS in Iron Man, and Vicki in I, Robot to name a few. 

While her purpose is to help her user - Savar - to have a buddy to help him in areas across his life, there is also a purpose to the process through which she is being created. It is to force him to learn, to practice, to teach, and to grow.

## Why
Not only to keep me high-performing, but to increase my performance and compound the improvement and progress every moment of every day that I am interacting with the tool. 

## Who
Me and my family. Starting with me, Savar Sareen, and a branching version available for my uncle, my cha-cha Rakesh Sareen. We are younger siblings. We have some form of ADHD or impulsivity. There's an aspect of perfectionism. There's an avoidant attachment style. There is a hesitation to put ourselves out there and be exposed. But there is desire to do good and there is self-awareness. 

## What
A tool, an entity that I can speak with, that can serve as my confidant, provide me encouragement, provide me feedback, be aware of when I need certain things, act as my backup memory, my backup real short-term memory for if I need help with remembering my to-do lists or specific things about other people as well.

Access to database as well as the short-term information and the ability to answer key questions that I return to on my own all the time:

1. What should I be doing right now?
2. Why am I doing this? (What am I really oriented around? What should I be focusing on and thinking about moving forward?)
3. Why do I keep getting distracted? How do I not get distracted?
4. What's next? (After I do this, what do I do next?)
5. Should I do this, or should I be doing something else?

## How
Typical paths:

Keeping focus on the task at hand
- I start to do something, and after starting, I think "oh there must be a better way to do this" or "I don't want to do this anymore; it would be more fun to do something else" or "I think this makes sense, but maybe someone's already done this. Does it still make sense for me to do it on my own?"
Prioritization
- What should I be doing right now? Should I be doing something for my fellowship or helping? Is there something I'm evidently forgetting to do that I know I should be doing? Where should I be going next? What was my prioritization?
Ideation
- What can I do?
Venting
- Why do I feel like this?


Core functions to build:

1. Pattern recognition of YOUR behavior
- When you're about to pivot
- What triggers loss of focus
- Which challenges actually energize you  

2. Intervention protocols
- Catch rationalization attempts
- Redirect that energy to optimization
- Force you to confront execution data
 
3. Action tracking
- Keep you locked on priority targets
- Show your mastery progression
- Prove your systems are working
